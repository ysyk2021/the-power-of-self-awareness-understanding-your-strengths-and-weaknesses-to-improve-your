Various assessment tools such as StrengthsFinder or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator can help individuals identify their personal strengths and weaknesses. These tools provide insights into an individual's personality type, character traits, and work style, allowing individuals to understand themselves better.

Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment, allowing individuals to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment. This technique helps individuals develop awareness of their emotions, allowing them to regulate them more effectively.
